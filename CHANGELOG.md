## [Unreleased]

For planned features and known issues see the [GitHub Issues list](https://github.com/AgreeDK/opensak/issues).

## [1.13.6] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Export to Google Maps (KML)** — New menu item under *GPS → Export to Google Maps (KML)…*
  exports the currently filtered caches to a `.kml` file that can be imported directly into
  [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/). The file contains two layers: one for
  geocaches (colour-coded by cache type with paddle icons) and one for custom waypoints.
  Corrected coordinates are used automatically when available.
  Options: include/exclude custom waypoints and already-found caches.

### Fixed

- **Corrected coordinates crash** — Setting corrected coordinates via right-click now saves
  correctly without crashing. The cache list updates immediately to show the 📍 indicator
  without requiring a manual refresh.

---

### [1.13.5] - 2026-05-07

---

**Update notification improvements**

- Update popup now includes a **"See changelog"** link opening the full changelog on GitHub
- Added **"Skip this version"** button — suppresses the popup for that release until a newer version is available
- Manual update check (Help → Check for updates) always shows the popup, regardless of skipped version
- Added automatic update check toggle in Settings → Advanced

---

## [1.13.4] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- **Light / Dark / Automatic theme** — A new *Appearance* section in Settings lets you choose
  between a light theme, a dark theme, or *Automatic* which follows the operating system setting.
  The change takes effect immediately without restarting. Dark mode is detected natively on
  macOS (System Preferences), Windows 10/11 (registry) and modern Linux desktops (freedesktop
  portal / GTK theme).

### Fixed

- **Consistent look across Linux, Windows and macOS** — OpenSAK now forces Qt's *Fusion* style
  on all platforms, giving a uniform baseline appearance regardless of the desktop environment
  or OS theme. A platform-appropriate default font is applied automatically (Segoe UI on Windows,
  SF Pro on macOS, Ubuntu on Linux).

- **Cache list text invisible in dark mode** — The GC code column delegate used hardcoded black
  text in all cases. Rows without a status colour (archived / found / placed) now use
  `palette.text()` so the text is readable in both light and dark themes. Status-coloured rows
  (red / yellow / green pastels) keep black text since the pastel backgrounds are always light.

- **Strikethrough and colour confined to GC code column** (fixes #196) — Strikethrough for
  archived caches and the orange disabled colour were previously applied to the cache name and
  type icon columns as well. They are now shown exclusively in the GC code column, making the
  status easier to read at a glance without affecting the other columns.

- **Theme change did not update all open windows** — Switching theme in Settings left already-
  visible widgets (including the cache list) unchanged until restart. The theme engine now
  explicitly propagates the new palette to every open window and its child widgets, so the
  entire UI updates in one go when you click OK.

---

## [1.13.3] — 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Colour-coded GC codes** (fixes #117) — Cache type colours are now applied to the GC code
  column in the cache list, making it easy to spot cache types at a glance. The colours in the
  *Count:* summary bar have been updated to match.

### Fixed

- **Strikethrough for archived and disabled caches** (fixes #118) — Cache entries that are
  archived or temporarily disabled are now shown with strikethrough text in the cache list,
  giving a clear visual indication that the cache is not currently active.

- **Delete database — empty folder cleanup** (fixes #146) — After deleting a database, OpenSAK
  now checks whether the containing folder is empty. If it is, a prompt is shown offering to
  delete the folder as well, so no orphaned folders are left behind.

---

## [1.13.2] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Found status and date set automatically on PQ import** — When importing a standard Pocket
  Query, caches you have found are now automatically marked as found and given the correct found
  date. OpenSAK reads the `<sym>Geocache Found</sym>` flag that Geocaching.com sets in PQ files
  for the requesting user's own finds, then locates your log entry to extract the exact date.
  Your Geocaching username (configured in Settings) is used to match the log; the numeric finder
  ID is learned automatically on first import and stored for faster matching in future imports.

### Fixed

- **FTF false positives on PQ import** — The First To Find flag was incorrectly set on all
  found caches when importing a Pocket Query. The previous detection logic checked whether the
  user's log was the earliest of the five logs shown in the PQ — but Geocaching.com only includes
  the five *most recent* logs, so an old find would often appear first among those five even if
  hundreds of people had found the cache earlier. FTF is now detected exclusively from keywords
  in the user's own log text (`FTF`, `First to find`, `First finder`, `Første til at finde`),
  which is the only reliable signal available from a standard PQ.

---

## [1.13.1] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Home location in Geocaching profile** (fixes #183) — A dedicated *Home location* field
  has been added to the *Geocaching profile* section in Settings. This sets a permanent
  home coordinate that is used as the default center point for all new databases and as the
  ★ Home entry in the location dropdown.

- **User locations renamed** (fixes #183) — The *Home coordinates* group in Settings has
  been renamed to *User locations* to better reflect its purpose. The ★ Home entry (from
  Geocaching profile) always appears at the top and cannot be edited or deleted from this
  list — it is managed exclusively via the Geocaching profile section.

- **Welcome dialog on first launch** (fixes #183) — If username or home location is not
  configured, a welcome dialog is shown a few seconds after startup prompting the user to
  open Settings and complete the setup.

### Fixed

- **Map centers on correct location at startup** (fixes #183) — The map now starts at the
  active location for the current database instead of a hardcoded position in Denmark. The
  starting coordinates are injected directly into the Leaflet HTML before the page loads,
  so the correct location is visible from the very first render.

- **Location saved per database** (fixes #183) — Switching the active location via the
  toolbar dropdown now correctly saves the chosen location for that specific database.
  Switching to a different database and back restores each database's own last-used location.

- **Toolbar dropdown reflects active location after DB switch** (fixes #183) — The location
  dropdown in the toolbar now correctly updates to show the active location for the newly
  selected database when switching databases.

- **New database uses Home location as default center** (fixes #183) — When creating a new
  database, the center point is automatically set to the Home location from the Geocaching
  profile. If no Home location is configured, the last active location is used as a fallback.

- **First cache no longer auto-selected on load** — After loading or refreshing caches, the
  first entry in the list was automatically selected and shown on the map without any user
  action. The list now loads with no selection, so the map is not unintentionally panned.

- **test_db_manager match patterns** — Four unit tests used raw translation keys as match
  patterns in `pytest.raises()`. Since `tr()` returns translated text, the patterns never
  matched and the tests always failed. Updated to match on stable substrings present in
  the translated messages.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Dutch translation** — OpenSAK is now available in Nederlands (Dutch). The translation
  was generated by Claude AI and has not yet been reviewed by a native speaker — feedback
  and corrections are welcome via GitHub issues or the Facebook group.
- **Last log date column** (fixes #186) — A new `Last log` column shows the date of the most
  recent log entry for each cache. The column can be sorted and is populated automatically for
  existing databases via a migration.
- **Enable / disable all cache types** (fixes #159) — The cache type filter now has an
  *Enable all / Disable all* toggle so you can quickly select or deselect every type at once.

### Improved

- **Search performance** (fixes #127) — Name and GC code searches are now pushed to SQL `LIKE`
  queries that exploit the existing B-tree index, making live search significantly faster on large
  databases. An adaptive debounce and minimum-character threshold reduce unnecessary queries while
  typing. Search settings (debounce delay and minimum characters) are available in the new
  *Advanced* tab in the Settings dialog.
- **Column widths are remembered** (fixes #96) — Manual column width adjustments are now saved
  and restored when the application is restarted.
- **Larger Save button in filter dialog** (fixes #98) — The *Save* button in the filter dialog
  is now larger and easier to click.

### Fixed

- **Home point not saved from Settings** (fixes #183) — Changes made to the home point in the
  Settings dialog were not persisted. The home point is now saved correctly.
- **Home point defaulting to Copenhagen** (fixes #183) — New databases incorrectly used
  Copenhagen as the default home location instead of the location chosen during setup.
- **Map not centred on home point at startup** (fixes #183) — The map now correctly centres on
  the active home point when the application loads.
- **Corrected coordinates** (fixes #73, #167) — Corrected coordinates from GPX files are now
  imported and stored. Caches with corrected coordinates are marked with an indicator in the
  cache list, and a new filter option lets you filter on whether a cache has corrected coordinates.
- **WHERE filter tooltip not translated** (fixes #170) — The tooltip/popup for the WHERE filter
  field was always shown in English. It is now translated in all 7 languages.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Attribute filter duplicates and missing header** (fixes #139) — The right-hand column in
  the attribute filter now has a proper section header. Duplicate entries that appeared when
  the filter dialog was opened more than once have been removed.
- **Missing geocache attributes** (fixes #139) — Three additional attribute IDs were missing
  after the initial fix: Jeeps (jeep tours), Drinking Water, and Livestock. All three are now
  present with translations in all 7 languages.
- **Database dialog — hardcoded strings** (fixes #149) — Several labels and button captions in
  the Database Manager dialog were hardcoded in English and are now fully translated via `tr()`.
- **Database dialog — path preview missing** (fixes #150) — The live path preview (folder +
  database name + `.db`) was not shown when creating a new database. It now updates as you type.
- **Database dialog — details label** (fixes #152) — The details/description label in the
  Database Manager was untranslated. Now uses `tr()` correctly.
- **Database dialog — selection lost on switch** (fixes #153) — Switching databases in the
  Database Manager dialog caused the selection highlight to be lost. The active database is now
  kept selected after a switch.
- **Home point — Activate button not disabled** (fixes #162) — The *Activate* button was enabled
  even when the selected home point was already the active one. It is now disabled when the point
  is already active. Home points are also stored per database, so switching databases restores
  the correct home point for that database.
- **Status icon showed 'C' on macOS** (fixes #156) — A spurious `C` icon appeared in the status
  column on macOS due to a platform-specific rendering difference. The icon is no longer shown.
- **Home dropdown — duplicate marker** (fixes #163) — The home point dropdown in the toolbar
  showed a double marker (★★) for the active entry. The selection colour was also hardcoded gray
  instead of following the system theme. Both issues are now fixed.
- **Edit home waypoint creates duplicate** (fixes #157) — Editing the name of an existing home
  waypoint and saving created a new entry instead of updating the existing one. The save logic
  now correctly identifies the existing record and updates it in place.

## [1.11.18] — 2026-04-30
### Fixed
- Version string bump to 1.11.18 (1.11.16 was not updated)

---

## [1.11.17] — 2026-04-30
### Added
- **Where-filter** (closes #17) — a powerful SQL-based OR filter that mirrors GSAK's
  "Where" functionality. Instead of chaining multiple passes through the database,
  a single filter expression combines any number of conditions (cache type, D/T,
  hidden date, size, attributes, …) into one efficient query. Contributed by Fabio.
- **Database switcher dropdown** in the toolbar (closes #17) — switch between databases
  without opening the Database Manager dialog.

### Fixed
- **Lat/Lon columns** (fixes #84) — latitude and longitude are now shown in the correct
  human-readable format (DMM / DMS / DD according to the user's preference) instead of
  raw decimal degrees.
- **Container sort** (fixes #90) — the Size/Container column now sorts in a logical order
  (Nano → Micro → Small → Regular → Large → Very Large → Other) instead of alphabetically.
- **Log counter** (fixes #87) — a new *Logs* column shows the total number of log entries
  for each cache. The count is populated automatically for existing databases via a migration.
- **Lab Cache label** — Lab Caches now show an `L` label in the size/type indicator column,
  consistent with the labels used for other special cache types.

---

## [1.11.16] — 2026-04-29
### Fixed
- Search field duplicated in filter dialog (fixes #86) — rolled back the change introduced
  in #80 that caused the search field to appear twice.
